NOTES FOR THE TEST DISCORD APP

    for the db going to need 
            ID
            LABEL optional
            ADDRESS
            FOLLOW

            label will only be used in discord side really

    probably want to make entry into db when follow is true
    then when they unsubscribe follow = false
    dont think we need to store all transactions 
    but we could store in a table 
        ID
        TRANS_ID
        TO
        FROM
        VALUE
        GAS
